# Stack

Stack is a game in which the goal is to stack blocks of color to build the highest tower.

To place the moving block, simply press <kbd>Space</kbd>.

Any part of the block which is not supported will be cut off.

If 8 blocks or more have been placed perfectly, i.e. without being cut, the blocks will become bigger but also move faster. Misplacing 1 block stops the streak and the game returns to its normal speed and same size blocks.

## Requirements

- Python 3 or higher
- Python modules: `pygame`
